# Reactjs + Bootstrap example website
A website to demonstrate my knowledge of Bootstrap, ReactJS and standard web technologies.
I found 'The Movie Database API' which anyone can use for free if your product is free.
Their API is laid out in such a way that makes it very easy to use.
I used ReactJS to load new data without full page reloads.
Finally I used bootstrap to quickly create an aesthetic and robust UI.

### Additions that could be made
- Adjust the URL based on the current search.
- Polish up loading, perhaps with an animated CSS spinner.

### Things learnt
- Doing checks on input prior to sending them as props can make things easier.
- Refined my understanding of the React Component Specs and Lifecycle.
- Bootstrap makes multi-platform websites **super** easy to make.
